## DQN implementation in tensorflow
based on
  * https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf
  * https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01905 (Action noise also available)
  * https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf
  * https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450


Default uses Parameter noise but can't really distinguish performance from Action Noise
